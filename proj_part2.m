%% Section 1: Reference Taps

% As mentioned in part 1, we began part 2 without a working implementation
% of reference taps. Although we wanted to move on to more important parts
% of the project (i.e. implement error correcting codes), this small part 
% of the equalizer bugged us (pun intended) and so, as will be seen in the 
% code to follow, we got the reference taps part of the equalizer working.

% Attached below, for the sake of completness, is our code from part 1
% updated with reference taps (there isn't so much to see here, the only
% difference is in the lines 59, 80-82, and 143.
%
% To shorten our code, we only considered 16-ary QAM modulation with an 
% rsl-dfe equalizer, printing out the BER rate at 12 SNR.


% Parameters: 
% We made the number of iterations large so that we could see the ber at 
% 12 SNR and confirm that it meets the specifications.
numIter = 10; 
n_sym = 1000;    % The number of symbols per packet
SNR_Val = 12;

% We are showing 16-ary QAM modulation 
M = 16;  

% Channel to use
chan = [1 .2 .4]; % Somewhat invertible channel impulse response, Moderate ISI

% Number of training symbols (max=len(msg)=1000)
numTrain = 350;

% equalizer hyperparameters
n_weights = 6;
n_weights_feedback = 7;

numRefTap = 3;

% Building the equalizer:
% adaptive filter algorithm
adaptive_algo = rls(1, 0.1);

% equalizer object
eqobj = dfe(n_weights, n_weights_feedback, adaptive_algo); % like IIR
eqobj.ResetBeforeFiltering = 0;
eqobj.RefTap = numRefTap;
delay = (numRefTap-1)/eqobj.nSampPerSym;

% Create a vector to store the BER computed during each iteration
berVec_no_eq = zeros(numIter, 1);
berVec_eq = zeros(numIter, 1);

% Running the simulation:
for i = 1:numIter
    
    % message to transmit
    bits = randi(2,[(n_sym+delay)*log2(M), 1])-1;
    msg = bits2msg(bits, M);
    
    % modulation
    tx = qammod(msg, M);  % QAM modulation

    % Sequence of Training Symbols
    train_seq = tx(1:numTrain);

    % transmit (convolve) through channel
    txChan_rs = filter(chan,1,tx);  % Apply the channel.
            
    % Adding AWGN. First need to convert from EbNo to SNR.
    noise_addition = 10*log10(log2(M));
    tx_noisy = awgn(txChan_rs, noise_addition+SNR_Val, 'measured');

    rx_demod_signal = equalize(eqobj,tx_noisy,train_seq);

    % de-modulation
    rx_rs = qamdemod(rx_demod_signal, M);  % QAM
    rx_no_rs = qamdemod(tx_noisy,M);

    rx_msg = msg2bits(rx_rs, M);
    rx_msg2 = msg2bits(rx_no_rs,M);

    % Compute and store the BER for this iteration
    % We're interested in the BER, which is the 2nd output of BITERR
    [~, berVec_eq(i,1)] = biterr(bits(1+numTrain:end-delay*log2(M)), rx_msg(1+numTrain+delay*log2(M):end));
    [~, berVec_no_eq(i,1)] = biterr(bits,rx_msg2);

end      % End numIter iteration

% Compute and plot the mean equalizer BER
ber_eq = mean(berVec_eq,1);
ber_no_eq = mean(berVec_no_eq,1);
berTheory = berawgn(SNR_Val, 'qam', M); % QAM

Types = {'Equalized', 'Not Equalized', 'Theoretical'}';
BER_Rate = [ber_eq, ber_no_eq, berTheory]';
Section_1_Table = table(Types, BER_Rate)

% Note that unlike in part 1 where we got BPSK down to 10^-4, we almost 
% nearly got 16-ary QAM down to the same requirement.


%% Section 2: BCH and BPSK

% With the reference taps implemented we moved on to error correcting 
% codes. At this point our group decided to work in parallel, with each 
% member looking at different error correcting codes. 

% The first code we tried was BCH with BPSK modulation. Although we didn't
% got this encoding working, we decided to move on to convolutional
% encoding and so we never finalized it into a working implementation.
%
% As such the code below neither works nor is not cleaned and efficient 
% but instead extensively documented. This was done by our group so that 
% we all understood the what, how and why behind every line. The following
% sections showcase a more complete implementation of other encodings.


% This try block is just a way to keep the syntax looking nice even though
% the code inside this block gives an error.

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% CREATING ERROR CONTROL CODING SCHEME %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    % The information to be encoded consists of message symbols and the code 
    % that is produced consists of codewords. Each block of K message symbols 
    % is encoded into a codeword that consists of N message symbols. K is 
    % called the message length, N is called the codeword length, and the code 
    % is called an [N,K] code.

    % You can structure messages and codewords as binary vector signals, where 
    % each vector represents a message word or a codeword. At a given time, the 
    % encoder receives an entire message word, encodes it, and outputs the 
    % entire codeword. The message and code signals operate over the same 
    % sample time.

    % BCH: For these codes, the codeword length N must have the form 2M-1, 
    % where M is an integer from 3 to 16 (default is 15). The message length K
    % is restricted to particular values that depend on N. To see which values 
    % of K are valid for a given N, see the comm.BCHEncoder System objectâ„¢ 
    % reference page. No known analytic formula describes the relationship 
    % among the codeword length, message length, and error-correction 
    % capability for BCH codes. Message length default is 5.

    X = 4; % integer from 3 to 16; 
    % NOTE: The documentation uses the variable M in place of x, but this is 
    % confusing because this value is different than the modulation value M.

    % CODEWORD LENGTH:
    n = 2^X-1; % default is 15, max allowed is 65,535
    % bchnumerr(n) will return all possible K/message values for a particular 
    % N and the number of correctable errors in a three column matrix.

    %MESSAGE LENGTH:
    k = 5; % default is 5, 
    % Example: 5 specifies a Galois array with five elements, 2^m (second 
    % value in gf).

    paritypos='beginning';
    % paritypos = 'end' or 'beginning' specify whether parity bits appear at 
    % the end or beginning of the signal.

    % The message must be fed into the encoder using the Galois field array of
    % symbols over GF(2). Each K-element row of msg represents a message word, 
    % where the leftmost symbol is the most significant symbol.

    %%%%%%%%%%% THIS IS LATER ON: msgTx = gf(x,1) will create a Galois array 
    % in GF(2^m).
    % The elements of x must be integers between 0 and 2^m-1, if only using bits
    % (x={0,1}), than m=1/second argument and we are in GF(2).

    %%%%%%%%%%% THIS IS LATER ON: enc = bchenc(msgTx,n,k,paritypos) occurs 
    % before adding noise and after converting from message to bits.
    % THIS IS HOW NOISE ADDITION IS DONE IN THE DOCUMENTATION 
    % EX:
    % Corrupt up to t bits in each codeword where t = bchnumerr(n,k)
    % noisycode = enc + randerr(numbits,n,1:t). This is for full
    % reconstruction with no errors and so doesnt concern us, because we are
    % anayways adding AWGN.

    %%%%%%%%%%% THIS IS LATER ON:msgRx = bchdec(noisycode,n,k) will decode 
    % the noisy message

% During our forray into BCH and Reed Solomon it became known to us that
% convolutional encoding is the superior error correcting code of the 
% three. We therefore turned all our attention to it.
%
% To implement the convolutional encoding, we reworked our skeleton script
% we have been using up until now. We made it more similar to the MATLAB
% documentation. 
% 
% Some of the things we tried to do to optimize the bit rate, while still
% maintaining the threshold BER was to twiddle with the equalizer
% parameters as well as the length of the training sequence and the 
% trellis & rate combination.
%
% We met the specs for M = 2, 8, and 16. However we spent the majority of
% our time was spent trying to get 32-ary to meet the specs. We decided to
% spend our effort on 32-ary QAM due to the boost in bits our bit rate
% would get - for every extra symbol we would be able to send an extra bit 
% as compared to 16-ary QAM, which ammounts to 900 extra bits in total.
%
% Our results are below, and these are our 'final' results that we would
% like considered for our project.
